In this scenario, the goal is to make sure the LTV to CAC ratios remain at 2 or higher so channels remain profitable even when absorbing occasional declines in LTV or spikes in acquisition costs. With this information, would you recommend a budget change for channels with results below 2 or above 3? Enter your recommendation below.
